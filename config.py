# ── Channel ordering ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# The "category list": the final playlist is arranged EXACTLY in the order of
# this list, top to bottom. Each entry is a keyword, matched as a whole word
# or phrase (case-insensitive) against the channel name — so "ATN" catches
# every ATN* channel (ATN Bangla, ATN News, ATN Music, ATN Bangla UK, ...),
# "Channel i" catches Channel I / Channel I UK / etc.
#
# A channel is placed under the FIRST keyword in this list that matches it.
# If a channel matches more than one keyword (e.g. "ATN Bangla" matches both
# "ATN" and "Bangla"), it goes under the EARLIER one.
#
# Channels that match NONE of these keywords are NOT dropped — they are simply
# appended after all listed channels (fastest-first), so no channel is missed.
#
# PERMANENT CHANNEL NUMBERS: every channel that matches the Nth keyword in
# this list (1-based) is permanently assigned channel number N. This number
# never changes between runs — it's tied to this list, not to which channels
# happened to survive. If you insert a new keyword, all channels after it get
# renumbered; if you only edit the ORDER of two keywords, their numbers swap.
# Channels matching no keyword keep getting numbers after the whole list.

SOURCE_TIMEOUT = 120    # seconds to wait when fetching a source playlist (raised for large Xtream panels)
CHECK_TIMEOUT  = 3      # max seconds for the ENTIRE check per channel (all manifest hops +
                        # the sustained-read window together). Lowered from 5s — most dead
                        # links respond within 1-2s; 3s is plenty for alive ones.

# True  → skip per-URL check (fast, finishes in minutes, keeps dead links)
# False → real GET + content-validated + sustained-throughput check (recommended)
SKIP_URL_CHECK = False

# How many retries on timeout before marking a URL dead (4xx/5xx are never retried)
# Set to 0 = hard check, one shot, no retries (fastest)
CHECK_RETRIES = 0

# How long (seconds) to keep reading actual media bytes to measure real
# throughput, once a segment/direct stream is found. Short enough to keep
# total run time reasonable across hundreds of channels, long enough to
# catch a stream that starts fine then stalls.
READ_WINDOW = 2.0

# Minimum sustained throughput (KB/s) required during READ_WINDOW for a
# channel to count as healthy. Below this, the stream is trickling data —
# which is what buffering looks like on the wire — and gets removed just
# like a dead channel. ~50 KB/s (~400 kbps) is a conservative floor below
# which most players will visibly stutter; raise it if clients still report
# buffering, lower it if too many legitimately slow-but-watchable channels
# are being dropped.
MIN_THROUGHPUT_KBPS = 50

# Channels that respond within this many seconds are kept. Anything alive but
# slower than this — likely to buffer in a player — is now REMOVED entirely,

# sorted fastest → slowest by latency.

# Safety net: if this run's final channel count collapses relative to the

# too strict this run), don't overwrite a working playlist with a broken
# one — keep the last good file and report the failure instead.
